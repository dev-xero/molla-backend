## Setup

To quickly bootstrap the project on your machine, follow these commands.

1. Clone the github repo:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-xero/molla-backend
   ```

 2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

 3. Run the development server:

    Running `yarn dev:watch` watches the typescript files for changes and restarts the server automatically, to prevent this behaviour, use `yarn dev`.

    ```bash
    yarn dev:watch
    ```
